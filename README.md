# RideShare - Web Application for Carpool Coordination -


## What is RideShare?

RideShare is a ride-sharing platform in the form of web application. It is similar to Uber or Lyft but with more focus on carpool matching, reservation of rides in advance, and easier driver registration for DePauw students. Riders can send requests for rides with specific time and location, and registered drivers can pick them up. The rider-driver matching and carpool recommendation system use machine learning and/or graph theoretic techniques to simultaneously optimize the pickup time and driver vehicle occupancy.

## Why RideShare?

Popular ride-sharing platforms such as Uber often have significantly high requirements on driver history and vehicles. Even though these requirements are for the sake of safety and liability for those companies, it sets a higher bar for people who cannot meet those requirements but want to be drivers. Especially, college students in rural areas (including DePauw University) face this exact issue. Many students who own vehicles cannot meet the requirements as Uber/Lyft drivers, but still would like to generate some income. Other students, who do not have their own vehicles, inevitably need to rely on their friends who are willing to drive in order to get anywhere outside of campus.

RideShare provides a platform where this demand (riders) and supply (drivers) meet. By automatically coordinating ride requests for carpooling, we can contribute for fuel efficiency and sustainability of the community.
